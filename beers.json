Beer Description\n\nAllagash Saison is our interpretation of a classic Belgian farmhouse style. It is a golden hued beer, brewed with a 2-Row blend, malted rye, oats and dark Belgian candi sugar. It was hopped with Tettnang, Bravo and Cascade hops. Fermented with a traditional saison yeast strain, this beer exhibits notes of spice and tropical fruit in the aroma. Citrus and a peppery spice dominate the flavor and make way for a pleasant malts\n\n# What You Should Know\n\nWhat is a Saison? Well, moyens de Saison en fran√ßais\\* (what Saison means in French) is \"season\", and Saisons were originally brewed in Belgium on farms for summer drinking. The beer would be brewed in the fall or winter to employ unoccupied farm workers and provide beer for seasonal laborers in the summer. Traditionally, these SaIsons would have strong yeast flavors but a crisp, light color. Originally, the Saisons would have had lower ABVs, in the 1900s the alcohol content started to creep up to 5%-7%. Today, there is great variety in what constitutes a Saison, but almost are extremely dry but still malty. Oh, and they are cool. Really cool. So there's that.\n\n\\*Note: this translation was definitely taken from Google Translate. Our apologies if makes no sense whatsoever.\n\n# The Boys' Take\n\nMan, Allagash sure does make good beer. This one is easy on the eyes (being a nice clear yellow) and in the mouth. It's gonna be dry, but very crisp and refreshing. Saisons can seem strange or confusing to the uninitiated, but don't be scared. They all (and especially this one) have a lot to offer!\n\n# About the Brewer\n\nAllagash is your serious Belgian brewery, and was one of the first (founded in 1994). Located in Portland, Maine (that's right, the other Portland), Allagash isn't flashy. But owner Rob Tod is committed to his craft, and if you like Belgians, man their beers are good. You're only going to find traditional recipes at this brewery, and a lot of beers that only get better with age. Why is this? Well, Allagash beers (similar to many styles of Belgian beer) are actually fermented twice. After the initial fermentation and bottling, more yeast and sugar are actually added, meaning Allagash beers are typically more carbonated and complex than other beers. Because of the added yeast, the flavor will continue changing, meaning after a few months, your may be totally different!\n\n# Drink this if You Like\n\nBelgian beer, Pale ales, Wheat beer\n\n# Ideal for People who Like\n\nFarmhouses, Belgium, a beer earned with manual labor\n\n# Drink While You Are\n\nOn the farm, cooling off after a long day\n\n# Pair With\n\nAsian, Farmhouse Food, Red Meat, French Cuisine\n","crispRich":0.6,"createdAt":"2016-01-11T03:13:51.217Z","drySweet":0.6,"ibu":null,"label":"https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-_468013_sm_387ba88a08eada1511c2ac4469ae29.jpeg","untappdID":"468013","brewer":"Allagash Brewing Company","untappdString":"Saison (Allagash Brewing Company)","pdfURL":"https://res.cloudinary.com/brewpublik/image/upload/v1496856939/fgt4mripzi0mderfrkja.pdf","style":"Saison / Farmhouse Ale","name":"Saison","tags":[{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tag","objectId":"5"},{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tag","objectId":"12"},{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tag","objectId":"19"},{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tag","objectId":"74"}],"searchedForUntappdID":true,"updatedAt":"2018-01-24T21:33:05.792Z","body":0.5,"abv":0.061,"collectionAssignments":[{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Collections","objectId":"uDClomdjZ5"}],"tier":{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tier","objectId":"1"},"maltHop":0.4,"objectId":"180","__type":"Object","className":"Beer"},{"untappdID":"1450449","name":"Where the Mild Things Are","brewer":"Ex Novo Brewing","abv":0,"ibu":18,"label":"https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-1450449_17b83_sm.jpeg","style":"English Mild Ale","createdAt":"2017-12-22T20:38:09.287Z","updatedAt":"2018-01-24T21:33:06.244Z","collectionAssignments":[{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Collections","objectId":"uDClomdjZ5"}],"objectId":"nDQMGizj3l","__type":"Object","className":"Beer"},{"createdAt":"2016-07-04T18:42:12.585Z","ibu":75,"name":"Dark Seas","brewer":"Mission Brewery","label":"https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-DarkSeas_77710.jpeg","untappdID":"77710","abv":0.098,"updatedAt":"2018-01-24T21:33:06.688Z","drySweet":0.72,"maltHop":0.36,"crispRich":0.78,"body":0.82,"searchedForUntappdID":true,"style":"Stout - Russian Imperial","collectionAssignments":[{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Collections","objectId":"NAe0smGkmn"}],"objectId":"z5kzeIe6vU","__type":"Object","className":"Beer"},{"maltHop":null,"brewer":"Abita","body":null,"ibu":0,"updatedAt":"2018-01-24T21:33:07.097Z","tier":{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tier","objectId":"2"},"createdAt":"2016-01-11T03:13:47.573Z","drySweet":null,"name":"Abbey Ale","abv":0,"crispRich":null,"tags":[{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tag","objectId":"5"},{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tag","objectId":"12"},{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tag","objectId":"19"},{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tag","objectId":"31"},{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tag","objectId":"44"},{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tag","objectId":"117"}],"untappdString":"Abbey Ale (Abita Brewing Company)","untappdID":"12228","searchedForUntappdID":true,"style":"Belgian Dubbel","collectionAssignments":[{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Collections","objectId":"uDClomdjZ5"}],"objectId":"160","__type":"Object","className":"Beer"},{"ibu":null,"updatedAt":"2018-01-24T21:33:07.680Z","untappdString":"Hennepin Farmhouse Saison (Brewery Ommegang)","abv":0.077,"brewer":"Brewery Ommegang","breweryDBID":"RsXBB4","name":"Hennepin Farmhouse Saison","untappdID":"402","createdAt":"2016-01-23T01:05:40.674Z","breweryDBString":"Hennepin Farmhouse Saison (Brewery Ommegang)","body":0.5,"crispRich":0.7,"drySweet":0.7,"maltHop":0.4,"label":"https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-_402_sm_7a21aec6f9892e6bfab4c2eef9471a.jpeg","searchedForUntappdID":true,"style":"Saison / Farmhouse Ale","collectionAssignments":[{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Collections","objectId":"KC8SrCBYdm"},{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Collections","objectId":"uDClomdjZ5"}],"objectId":"JBFply4wqz","__type":"Object","className":"Beer"},{"description":"\n# Beer Description\n\nMost breweries have at least one piece of equipment that's just a bit persnickity. Here at Boulevard it's fermenter number seven, the black sheep of our cellar family. Ironically, when our brewers were developing variations on a traditional Belgian-style farmhouse ale, the perfect combination of elements came together in that very vessel. You could call it fate, but they called it Tank 7, and so it is. Beginning with a flavorful surge of fruity aromatics and hoppy, grapefruit notes (Amarillo hops), this complex, straw-colored ale finishes long, dry and spicy.\n\n# The Boy's Take\n\nA very traditional Belgian Saison with just a little extra floral hops, and grapefruit citrus notes. As with all the smokestack series this beer is premium in quality and another great traditional Belgian style brew from Boulevard.\n\n# About the Brewer\n\nBoulevard has been a fixture in Kansas City since 1989 and is now a household name in much of the Midwest. In fact, if you're in the Midwest, you won't be able to get away from the ubiquitous (and award-winning) Unfiltered Wheat Beer. Honestly, we think a lot of Boulevard's beers are very Midwestern: not as brash as the West Coast, not as scrappy as the East Coast- just high-quality and presented simply. And it seems to have worked. Founder John McDonald originally planned for 6000 barrels of beer a year in his business plan. Now, the capacity is over 600,000 barrels. I'd say that business plan worked. The two biggest sellers are Unfiltered Wheat and Boulevard Pale Ale, but we encourage you to venture to try a few others, like the Tank 7 Farmhouse Ale, the Double Wide IPA and the Saison-Brett\n\n# Drink this if You Like\n\nWheat beers, yeasty and fruity beer, Hefeweizens\n\n# Ideal for People who Like\n\nFairy tales, Midwestern values, Belgian (but not really, Dutch) values\n\n# Drink While You Are\n\nMaking the best of a bad situation, making lemonade out of lemons.\n\n# Pair With\n\nCitrus summer salad, Salmon, Grilled chicken, Veggie Burger.\n","crispRich":0.5,"createdAt":"2016-01-11T03:13:49.835Z","drySweet":0.4,"ibu":null,"label":"https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-10891_26699_sm.jpeg","untappdID":"10891","brewer":"Boulevard Brewing Co.","untappdString":"Tank 7 Farmhouse Ale (Boulevard Brewing Co.)","pdfURL":"https://res.cloudinary.com/brewpublik/image/upload/v1516378989/dsr18zhyoyrnozkclh90.pdf","style":"Saison / Farmhouse Ale","name":"Tank 7 Farmhouse Ale","tags":[{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tag","objectId":"5"},{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tag","objectId":"12"},{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tag","objectId":"19"},{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tag","objectId":"74"}],"searchedForUntappdID":true,"updatedAt":"2018-01-24T21:33:08.089Z","body":0.3,"abv":0.085,"collectionAssignments":[{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Collections","objectId":"uDClomdjZ5"}],"maltHop":0.4,"tier":{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tier","objectId":"2"},"objectId":"268","__type":"Object","className":"Beer"},{"untappdID":"623282","name":"Puck, The Beer","label":"https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-623282_bf3fb_sm.jpeg","brewer":"North Coast Brewing Company","abv":0.04,"ibu":27,"createdAt":"2017-03-03T18:01:27.936Z","updatedAt":"2018-01-24T21:33:08.527Z","searchedForUntappdID":true,"style":"Saison / Farmhouse Ale","collectionAssignments":[{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Collections","objectId":"uDClomdjZ5"}],"objectId":"idB1WBYId3","__type":"Object","className":"Beer"},{"createdAt":"2016-04-19T01:10:05.220Z","updatedAt":"2018-01-24T21:33:08.942Z","name":"Smoked Porter","untappdID":"4084","abv":0.001,"brewer":"Alaskan Brewing Co.","label":"https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-4084_2b271_sm.jpeg","ibu":45,"searchedForUntappdID":true,"style":"Smoked Beer","collectionAssignments":[{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Collections","objectId":"NAe0smGkmn"}],"objectId":"Rnhty1jmab","__type":"Object","className":"Beer"},{"name":"Le Merle","createdAt":"2016-05-31T21:02:22.149Z","ibu":null,"brewer":"North Coast Brewing Company","label":"https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-LeMerle_9619.jpeg","updatedAt":"2018-01-24T21:33:09.337Z","untappdID":"9619","abv":0.079,"drySweet":0.57,"maltHop":0.38,"crispRich":0.56,"body":0.62,"searchedForUntappdID":true,"style":"Saison / Farmhouse Ale","collectionAssignments":[{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Collections","objectId":"uDClomdjZ5"}],"objectId":"hUTIfwslSV","__type":"Object","className":"Beer"},{"untappdID":"30855","createdAt":"2016-02-06T17:48:21.357Z","updatedAt":"2018-01-24T21:33:09.748Z","abv":0.09,"brewer":"North Coast Brewing Company","ibu":null,"name":"Old Rasputin","maltHop":0.2,"drySweet":0.8,"crispRich":0.8,"body":0.9,"label":"https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-30855_44785_sm.jpeg","searchedForUntappdID":true,"style":"Stout -

Nut Brown Ale is relatively dry with a rich amber-brown color and nutty flavor derived exclusively from small amounts of dark malt. Brown ales are a specialty of northern England. Fermented in 'stone Yorkshire squares'.\n\n# What you should know\n\nThe specific well water in Yorkshire, England helps form the base of this traditional brew. Samuel Smith's \"Taddy\" brewery is also one of the few that uses the Yorkshire Square method of brewing, which actually separates the wort (the boiled malt) from yeasty foam at the top. Periodically, some of the wort is pumped up into the yeast to feed it. Finally, the wort is drained, leaving the yeast behind, and a fairly bitter wort. Fortunately, there is enough residual yeast to stay back and continue to soften the taste. It's a laborious method, but it seems to work for Samuel Smith's\n\n# The Boys' Take\n\nWe love our English traditional style beers and Sam Smith's Nut Brown is a perfect example of the style. malty, smooth, toasty flavors, and a medium plus body is perfect for a fall evening!\n\n# About the Brewer\n\nThe original brewery that Samuel Smith started from started in 1758, although it wasn't until a couple of generations has passed when the true brewery started operations in 1847. Shortly after, old Samuel developed his yeast strain, and the brewery still uses it today- one of the longest continuous yeast strains there are. Plus, they still deliver their beer using horses (well, around Yorkshire, at least). There's also a line of over 300 pubs run by Samuel Smith's throughout England.

The woody, vanilla-like notes imparted by the barrels mingle with aromas of fresh baked bread, toffee, and espresso and envelop the rich chocolate and roasted barley flavors with a fine bourbon character. Our exclusive partnership with Wild Turkey gives Anderson Valley a world class, consistent source of barrelage, allowing our brewers to explore new frontiers in barrel-aged craft beer.\n\n# What you should know\n\nBarrel-aging is a tradition going back to pre-Prohibition days. Way before breweries were the space-age industrial things that they are today, beer was aged in good-ole wooden barrels. The cool thing is that the beer will actually take on the character both of the wood and the previous occupant of the barrel. In addition, various microorganisms in the barrel mix with the yeast already in the brew and have a real party, leading to a beer that is wonderfully bourbon flavored and more complex than usual.\n\n# The Boy's Take\n\nThis is a manly drink. Just say the word bourbon and our mouths start to water, but we're a beer company, so naturally we keep the Anderson Valley version around to keep ourselves satisfied. This is good stuff, people.\n\n# About the Brewer\n\nAhh, Anderson Valley, in beautiful, pastoral Booneville, CA, using solarpower and pixie-dust to create some of the best-drinking, smoothest ales around. The original brewery was in the basement of a brewpub run by Ken Allen, and beer operations started in earnest way back in 1987. After really killing it for a few years, Ken moved to a huge, gleaming brewhouse in the middle of nowhere in Northern Cali. Well, in 2010 Ken did retire, leaving the company to Trey White, who partnered with brewmaster Fal Allen (no relation to Ken). Since then Trey and Fal have taken Anderson Valley national and jumped whole-heartedly into seasonal and barrel-aging scene.

However, since establishment in 1871, they seem to have used their power for niceness instead of evil. The Moortgat family actually started the brewery on their farm, and during WWI, they came into contact with English ales. They liked these so much that head brewer Albert journeyed across Britain until he found a Scottish strain that Brewery Moortgat still uses to this day.

Beer Description\n\nThe Sculpin IPA is a testament to our humble beginnings as Home Brew Mart. Founded in 1992, the Mart continues to be a catalyst for the San Diego brewing scene, setting the trend for handcrafted ales. Inspired by our customers, employees and brewers, the Sculpin IPA is bright with aromas of apricot, peach, mango and lemon. Its lighter body also brings out the crispness of the hops. This delicious Ballast Point Ale took a Bronze Medal at the 2007 Great American Beer Festival in the Pro Am category. The Sculpin fish has poisonous spikes on its fins that can give a strong sting. Ironically, the meat from a Sculpin is considered some of the most tasty. Something that has a sting but tastes great, sounds like a Ballast Point India Pale Ale.\n\n# What you should know\n\nThis beer is hoppy, but doesn't rely on brute force to bring across the delicious. The use of lighter, soft malts (only four varieties) leads to a light body that really showcases the bright hop taste. Unusually, hops are actually added during the mashing process, to give a nice oily feel and taste.\n\n# The Boys' Take\n\nThere's a reason a lot of people will say this is literally the best American IPA! The hops are allowed free reign to really show themselves off, and there is so much flavor- mango, grapefruit, pine. Treat this like Skittles. Taste the rainbow.\n\n# About the Brewer\n\nBallast Point, out of San Diego, started as a small group of home brewers who just wanted to try some new beers. Their constant thirst for experimentation and exploration has now grown to one of the giants of the massive San Diego brewing scene. Their M-O is to constantly tinker, try to release new options, look at things from new angles and make room for themselves in what can be a crowded craft beer world. As a side note, they also distill liquor- so check that out. Founder Jack White started with just a homebrew kit at his house in 1992, and by 1996, the brewery had been born. Today, they make just about every style, with favorites being the IPAs Sculpin, Big Eye, Dorado Double and the porter, Victory at Sea\n\n# Drink this if You Like\n\nFruity or tropical IPAs, IPAs in general\n\n# Ideal for People who Like\n\nThe tropics, fishing, the sunny climes of San Diego\n\n# Drink While You Are\n\nEnduring a brutal winter and wishing you were in San Diego, dealing with a hot summer and wishing you were in San Diego\n\n# Food Pairings\n\nTropical savory foods (think flavored by coconut), Jerk Chicken, Tropical fruit\n","createdAt":"2016-01-11T03:13:49.119Z","crispRich":0.6,"drySweet":0.6,"ibu":null,"label":"https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-_5558_sm_568370b6ade3c2ed1ffd9a311fa92f.jpeg","untappdID":"5558","brewer":"Ballast Point Brewing Company","untappdString":"Sculpin IPA (Ballast Point Brewing & Spirits)","style":"IPA - American","name":"Sculpin","tags":[{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tag","objectId":"5"},{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tag","objectId":"19"},{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tag","objectId":"49"},{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tag","objectId":"53"}],"searchedForUntappdID":true,"updatedAt":"2018-01-24T21:33:38.687Z","body":0.6,"abv":0.07,"collectionAssignments":[{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Collections","objectId":"WoCDBsP7Pr"}],"maltHop":0.8,"tier":{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tier","objectId":"1"},"objectId":"232","__type":"Object","className":"Beer"},{"createdAt":"2016-01-25T05:05:30.062Z","crispRich":null,"breweryDBString":"Fresh Squeezed IPA (Deschutes Brewery)","ibu":null,"breweryDBID":"NKIjJb","drySweet":null,"label":"https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-59622_33e95_sm.jpeg","untappdID":"59622","untappdString":"Fresh Squeezed IPA (Deschutes Brewery)","brewer":"Deschutes Brewery","pdfURL":"https://res.cloudinary.com/brewpublik/image/upload/v1496238272/wpoxwreoja5qcoilrsrx.pdf","style":"IPA - American","name":"Fresh Squeezed IPA","searchedForUntappdID":true,"updatedAt":"2018-01-24T21:33:39.117Z","body":null,"abv":0.064,"collectionAssignments":[{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Collections","objectId":"WoCDBsP7Pr"}],"maltHop":null,"objectId":"yLh3SUXvI2","__type":"Object","className":"Beer"},{"name":"Funk Me","brewer":"Black Hammer Brewing","abv":0.0725,"ibu":30,"label":"https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-2282672_bb95e_sm.jpeg","untappdID":"2282672","createdAt":"2017-10-10T14:03:49.770Z","updatedAt":"2018-01-24T21:33:39.493Z","collectionAssignments":[{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Collections","objectId":"WoCDBsP7Pr"}],"objectId":"zChJhrZTfh","__type":"Object","className":"Beer"},{"untappdID":"717782","name":"Eliot IPA","label":"https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-717782_f526d_sm.jpeg","brewer":"Ex Novo Brewing","abv":0.066,"ibu":50,"createdAt":"2017-03-22T21:08:46.860Z","updatedAt":"2018-01-24T21:33:39.882Z","searchedForUntappdID":true,"style":"IPA - American","collectionAssignments":[{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Collections","objectId":"WoCDBsP7Pr"}],"objectId":"VFrNghcnnF","__type":"Object","className":"Beer"},{"createdAt":"2016-08-16T18:14:36.315Z","brewer":"Speakeasy Ales & Lagers","untappdID":"808","label":"https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-_808_0a31150e943cd283e16a63010f98.jpeg","updatedAt":"2018-01-24T21:33:40.273Z","name":"Double Daddy Imperial IPA","abv":0.085,"ibu":null,"searchedForUntappdID":true,"style":"IPA - Imperial / Double","collectionAssignments":[{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Collections","objectId":"WoCDBsP7Pr"}],"objectId":"YbLup3wGBD","__type":"Object","className":"Beer"},{"description":"\n# Beer Description\n\nA style of beer curiously born on the foggy shores\nof Father Junipero Serra‚Äôs first founding mission.

Dan\nSells got it restarted, and soon he needed the space to move into a\nhistoric Wonder Bread facility in downtown San Diego.

A successful craft brewer since 1993, Uinta brews a variety of amazing beers, but is based in Salt Lake City, Utah- a state where only beers under 4% ABV are allowed in grocery stores (anything else is treated like liquor).

First of all a perfectly balanced blend of qualities, the ability to stand out, be authoritative without overpowering. Show courage and endurance, you will lead the way and set the standards. Very important, be appealing and refreshing to the people. This stereotypical portrait applies whether referring to politics, religion or maybe even this outstanding IPA\n\n# What You Should Know\n\nThe name of this brew comes from the hops used, called Falconer's Flight- a blend of 7 different varieties of Pacific Northwest hops. This leads to a unique flavor profile and is just as simple as dropping one variety in the brew. Time-saver!\n\n# The Boys' Take\n\nOn the softer, easy-going side of IPAs, Falco has a decently light body that really showcases the fruity hops included here. There is bitterness at the end, but it's not biting. The caramel maltiness of this IPA is a little more prominent than some others.\n\n# About the Brewer\n\nEvil Twin is unique. It's a gypsy brewery, meaning it develops the recipes, but uses breweries across the world to actually make the beer. This means it isn't committed to a solid list of beers that it makes at its brewery.

It's hopped with Warrior and Glacier varieties. Primary fermentation takes place in open vessels using two yeast strains, one American and one English. For added complexity, the beer is conditioned on barrel staves of French Oak for four months before being dry hopped with Glacier at the rate of a half-pound per barrel. This elixir is then blended 50/50 with 90 Minute IPA. After blending, the beer will measure 80 IBU and 10% abv.\n\n# What you should know\n\nSo this beer is actually a mix of the Dogfish Head 90-Minute IPA recipe and a Glacier-hopped amber cocktail that is aged on French Oak barrels. Glacier hops are a variant of the original English-style hops, but there here to contribute more flavor than bitterness, as the 90-Minute IPA brings more than enough of that to the table.\n\n# The Boys' Take\n\nImagine the deliciousness of Dogfish Head 90-minute, but with a huge boozy, malty base to play with,. This one starts big and boozy and bitter before finishing up with some really interesting caramel and vanilla notes. This is something you've got to try\n\n# About the Brewer\n\nDogfish Head Brewery sees itself as the maverick in an already free-spirited industry, and relishes this role. Founder Sam Calagione started the brewery in Milton, DE in 1995 and now spends much time on television discussing the craft beer industry. In fact, at least on the east coast, it's hard to avoid DFH- there's a hotel, a tv show and even sausages for heaven's sake! But they do make amazing beer, often with unique flavor combinations and even stranger names. 90-Minute IPA is the more extreme version of one of Dogfish's signature brews (the 60-minute IPA). If you like this beer, try the 60-minute for session drinking or the Burton Baton for a full experience.\n\n# Drink If you Like\n\nBig Belgians, barrel-aged beer, stouts, Imperial IPAs\n\n# Ideal for People who Like\n\nThe fact that we said Big Belgians above, sipping beer, everything oaked\n\n# Drink While You Are\n\nSitting in a big leather chair, smoking a cigar\n\n# Pair With\n\nToasted nuts, peanut sauce, spicy food\n","crispRich":0.7,"createdAt":"2016-01-11T03:13:48.788Z","drySweet":0.7,"ibu":70,"label":"https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-6105_5a13b_sm.jpeg","untappdID":"6105","brewer":"Dogfish Head Craft Brewery","untappdString":"Burton Baton (Dogfish Head)","style":"IPA -

Our recipe highlights the known ingredients of barley, white Muscat grapes, honey and saffron. Somehwere between a beer, wine and mead, this smooth, dry ale will please with Chardonnay or I.P.A. drinker alike.\n\n# What you should know\n\nDogfish Head is a little nutty. The brewery has been working with biomolecular archaeologist Dr. Patrick McGovern to research ancient brewing habits. Well, when Dr. McGovern worked with the team that uncovered the tomb of King Midas, Unbelievably, there was still residue from the king's last feast on vessels buried with him. Well of course, that means it was time to copy the recipe! What resulted from this craziness is Midas Touch\n\n# The Boys' Take\n\nWhat a fascinating beer! It's sweet, tart, and unlike many beers, actually tastes a little like grapes. The first sips taste of white wine, followed by some malty toasted flavor, maybe even some strawberry jam? I mean, if you're going to drink like a king, might as well drink like King Midas!\n\n# About the Brewer\n\nDogfish Head Brewery sees itself as the maverick in an already free-spirited industry, and relishes this role. Founder Sam Calagione started the brewery in Milton, DE in 1995 and now spends much time on television discussing the craft beer industry. In fact, at least on the east coast, it's hard to avoid DFH- there's a hotel, a tv show and even sausages for heaven's sake! But they do make amazing beer, often with unique flavor combinations and even stranger names.\n\n# Drink this if You Like\n\nWhite wine, pale beers, Belgian beers\n\n# Ideal for People who Like\n\nScience! Archaeology, Ancient Greece\n\n# Drink While You Are\n\nDebating the classics, enjoying book club\n\n# Pair With\n\nAsian dishes, risotto, curry, baked fish + chicken\n","createdAt":"2016-01-11T03:13:49.500Z","crispRich":0.3,"drySweet":0.4,"ibu":null,"label":"https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-dfhMidaTouch.jpg","untappdID":"14172","brewer":"Dogfish Head Craft Brewery","untappdString":"Midas Touch (Dogfish Head)","style":"Spiced / Herbed Beer","name":"Midas Touch","tags":[{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tag","objectId":"5"},{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tag","objectId":"19"},{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tag","objectId":"118"}],"searchedForUntappdID":true,"updatedAt":"2018-01-24T21:34:12.777Z","body":0.3,"abv":0.09,"collectionAssignments":[{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Collections","objectId":"Gg11Nv1F1y"}],"maltHop":0.4,"tier":{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tier","objectId":"1"},"objectId":"330","__type":"Object","className":"Beer"},{"ibu":null,"name":"Liliko'i Kepolo","createdAt":"2016-03-03T19:37:51.032Z","updatedAt":"2018-01-24T21:34:13.221Z","untappdID":"127388","abv":0.054,"brewer":"Avery Brewing Co.","searchedForUntappdID":true,"style":"Witbier","collectionAssignments":[{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Collections","objectId":"Gg11Nv1F1y"}],"objectId":"0ZNOQHFsXl","__type":"Object","className":"Beer"},{"untappdID":"196334","name":"Cool Breeze Pils","brewer":"Baird Brewing Company","abv":0.001,"ibu":40,"label":"https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-196334_3fe13_sm.jpeg","style":"Pilsner -

This ale is dark in\ncolor without the heavy taste of porter or stout.\n\n# What you should know\n\nBrown Ales originated in England, where ales\nwith the dark brown malts started to appear in the in 1700s. The\noriginal brown ales struggled against pale malts, which were more\nefficient in brewing. However, the style came back in the end of the\n19^th^ century and then became a mainstay in the new American craft\nbrewing.\n\n# The Boys‚Äô Take\n\nMan, this is good! Chocolate, vanilla, and a hint\nof nuttiness all combine and for a smooth, easy-drinking and flat-out\ndelicious beer.\n\n# About the Brewer\n\nThe Lost Coast Brewery and Caf√© began with a\ndream. In 1986 Barbara Groom, a pharmacist wondered what it would\nrequire to start a brewpub. After years honing her skills home brewing,\nplanning and studying scores of pubs throughout England & Wales Barbara\nwas ready to transform the dream into a reality. Since its humble\nbeginning in 1990, the brewery has outgrown not just its original\nfacility in the Pythian Castle, but has also outgrown the site it moved\nto in 1993 just down the street. After a long successful 25 years and\nbreaking two production records in 2005 with 24,000 barrels, and 2009\nwith over 50,000 barrels, the brewery is now located at the south end of\nEureka, California in a brand new state of the art facility. Barbara\nGroom designed it to not only make exceptional brews in, but to be open\nfor the public to enjoy as well, opening Summer 2015. Currently the new\nfacility is brewing at a 90,000-barrel capacity and is still working to\nbrew to greater heights!\n\n# Drink this if You Like\n\nSmooth beers, milk stouts, brown ales\n\n# Ideal for People who Like\n\nCity life, Taxi rides, painting the town\n\n# Drink While You Are\n\nOut on the town, Taking in the city\n\n# Pair With\n\nRoasted meat, spicy meat, ancho chilis, chipotle\n","crispRich":0.6,"createdAt":"2016-01-11T03:13:49.099Z","drySweet":0.6,"ibu":null,"label":"https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-1402_f3419_sm.jpeg","untappdID":"1402","brewer":"Lost Coast Brewery","untappdString":"Downtown Brown (Lost Coast Brewery)","style":"Brown Ale - English","name":"Downtown Brown","tags":[],"searchedForUntappdID":true,"updatedAt":"2018-01-24T21:34:32.096Z","body":0.6,"abv":0.05,"collectionAssignments":[{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Collections","objectId":"HEansk5RZl"}],"tier":{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tier","objectId":"2"},"maltHop":0.3,"objectId":"1160","__type":"Object","className":"Beer"},{"description":"\n# Beer Description\n\nBoasting a ruby hue and an exquisite floral aroma, Red Nectar is a robust yet elegant brew with distinctive accents of toasted malt, caramel, spice and residual sweetness. The beer that started it all‚Ä¶ Red Nectar was considered a strange bird when it was first released in 1987. After all, where did a robust, handcrafted all-natural amber ale fit into the massive flock of American industrial lagers? Answer: it didn't. So it blazed its own trail, helping set the pace for the craft brew revolution. Enjoy Red Nectar for its dazzling reddish copper hue, original flavors and caramel spice accents\n\n# The Boys' Take\n\nFlavorful, tasty and malty. This one starts sweet with the smell and the taste- maybe a little bit like a snack of fruit, then there's a spice taste. Finally, you may feel some slight fruity hops hit the back of your throat. Amber ales are normally a relatively tame bunch, but this one has some complexity.\n\n# About the Brewer\n\nThese guys made the first hemp beer. That might be all you need to know about Humboldt. One of the first craft microbreweries, Humboldt started way back in 1987 in northern California. They live at peace with nature and generally minimize their carbon footprint, and who doesn't love that? In 2005, the little Humboldt brewery was bought by Firestone Walker, and then by Total Beverage Solutions. For a while, it was actually known as Nectar Ale after the flagship Red Nectar ale.

We begin with a rich, dark, English-style ale and then we improvise with spices until we know we have a beer worth sharing with the nation. Celebrating the right to be original.\n\n# What You Should Know\n\nWinter warmers are generally characterized by big malt flavor, and a wide variety of spices (more a feature of American interpretations rather than the original English style). They also typically carry higher alcohol content. Fireside Chat is brewed with a delicious medley of spices and also cocoa nibs to give a slight chocolate flavor.\n\n# The Boys' Take\n\nAsk Zach about this beer, and he'll tell you it's dope! An office favorite, Fireside Chat is rich, but without being overpowering and the mix of spices is just delightful.\n\n# About the Brewer\n\nIt's the brewer that puts its beer in cans! 21st Amendment makes beer in those little stubby guys, and it stands out in the midst of rows of bottles, They also made the very fortuitous decision to bring craft beer to South Park, in the epicenter of San Francisco urban revival. These factors make 21st Amendment one of the coolest. For some reason, there's just nothing like beer in a can. Similar to many other brewers, 21st focuses on themes of freedom and originality- but ironically, their beer is similar to many other west-coast brewers- aggressive, inventive, and delicious.

Their constant thirst for experimentation and exploration has now grown to one of the giants of the massive San Diego brewing scene.  Their M-O is to constantly tinker, try to release new options, look at things from new angles and make room for themselves in what can be a crowded craft beer world.  As a side note, they also distill liquor- so check that out.  Founder Jack White started with just a homebrew kit at his house in 1992, and by 1996, the brewery had been born.   Today, they make just about every style, with favorites being the IPAs Sculpin, Big Eye, Dorado Double and the porter, Victory at Sea.\n\n# Drink this if You Like\n\nAmber Ales, Pale Ales, IPAs\n\n# Ideal for People who Like\n\nSan Diego, Coronado, Something a little bit extra.\n\n# Drink While You Are\n\nEating sushi, resting after kiteboarding\n\n# Pair With\n\nSweet Hawaiian fish, mango chutney burger, Hawaiian BBQ. \n","crispRich":0.6,"createdAt":"2016-01-11T03:13:51.322Z","drySweet":0.6,"ibu":0,"untappdID":"5133","brewer":"Ballast Point","untappdString":"Calico Amber Ale (Ballast Point Brewing & Spirits)","pdfURL":"https://res.cloudinary.com/brewpublik/image/upload/v1496244417/cwvk04jk1x83ewr12fpq.pdf","style":"Red Ale - American Amber / Red","name":"California Amber","tags":[{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tag","objectId":"3"},{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tag","objectId":"5"},{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tag","objectId":"19"},{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tag","objectId":"117"}],"searchedForUntappdID":true,"updatedAt":"2018-01-24T21:31:53.308Z","body":0.5,"abv":0.055,"collectionAssignments":[{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Collections","objectId":"HEansk5RZl"}],"maltHop":0.5,"tier":{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tier","objectId":"2"},"objectId":"756","__type":"Object","className":"Beer"},{"abv":0.058,"ibu":40,"name":"Black House","createdAt":"2016-08-16T00:20:56.705Z","label":"https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-384798_44a1a_sm.jpeg","untappdID":"384798","updatedAt":"2018-01-24T21:31:57.593Z","brewer":"Modern Times Beer","searchedForUntappdID":true,"style":"Stout - Oatmeal","collectionAssignments":[{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Collections","objectId":"HEansk5RZl"}],"objectId":"dnruk7QYHH","__type":"Object","className":"Beer"},{"crispRich":0.7,"createdAt":"2016-01-11T03:13:49.855Z","drySweet":0.7,"ibu":30,"label":"https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-2025_353a7_sm.jpeg","untappdID":"2025","brewer":"Deschutes Brewery","untappdString":"Black Butte Porter (Deschutes Brewery)","pdfURL":"https://res.cloudinary.com/brewpublik/image/upload/v1496072394/jfjxpculb5y2h2s4crt3.pdf","style":"Porter - American","name":"Black Butte Porter","tags":[{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tag","objectId":"70"}],"searchedForUntappdID":true,"updatedAt":"2018-01-24T21:34:38.638Z","body":0.7,"abv":0.052,"collectionAssignments":[{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Collections","objectId":"HEansk5RZl"}],"maltHop":0.3,"tier":{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tier","objectId":"2"},"objectId":"1356","__type":"Object","className":"Beer"},{"createdAt":"2016-01-25T05:00:18.517Z","crispRich":null,"breweryDBString":"Red Trolley Ale (Karl Strauss Brewing Company)","ibu":null,"breweryDBID":"igHAmp","drySweet":null,"label":"https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-1291_2cdbc_sm.jpeg","untappdID":"1291","brewer":"Karl Strauss Brewing Company","untappdString":"Red Trolley Ale (Karl Strauss Brewing Company)","pdfURL":"https://res.cloudinary.com/brewpublik/image/upload/v1495831874/c4tpeqz3xe6bis4cghgn.pdf","style":"Red Ale - Irish","name":"Red Trolley Ale","searchedForUntappdID":true,"updatedAt":"2018-01-24T21:32:00.558Z","body":null,"abv":0.058,"collectionAssignments":[{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Collections","objectId":"HEansk5RZl"}],"maltHop":null,"objectId":"lPH0at5noH","__type":"Object","className":"Beer"},{"description":"\n# Beer Description\n\nRare Vos is flemmish for \"Sly Fox,\" and the name of one of Brussels' great cafes. It has a sweetly fruity malt character and yeasty spiciness. A fine dose of yeast permits the beer to mature and mellow in the bottle.\n\n# What you should know\n\nThe name is inspired by the caf√©s (such as Rare Vos) that serve these soft, yeasty amber ales all throughout Belgium. This one of the maltier brews on offer for Ommegang and features Styrian Goulding hops.\n\n# The Boys' Take\n\nRare Vos will remind you a little of cherries and other dark fruit as you sip it, but not in an overpowering way. Most of the flavors are mellow and soft, with the yeast flavor definitely still shining through. It remains light throughout and finishes dry. Sorta like a gassed water you might be given at a Flemish caf√©.\n\n# About the Brewer\n\nOmmegang is a farmstead brewery completely fashion after old-school Belgian traditions. The brewery is actually situated in the middle of an old hops farm in Cooperstown, NY. Cooperstown, the home of the Baseball Hall of Fame now, used to also be home to the largest hop-growing area in the US (pre-prohibition). Anyway, with the help of Duvel (a Belgian brewing conglomerate), the farmhouse was built in 1997, In 2003, Duvel went ahead and purchased the brewery. In brewing premium Belgian ales, Ommegang draws on the special water available in the area, imported Bavarian hops and their own house yeast. Together, all these ingredients lead to a very impressive combination of Belgians brewed in the US. In fact, the Hennepin Saison was the very first Saison brewed in the US and help resurrect a style that was in danger of dying.\n\n# Drink if you Like\n\nDubbels, lambics, Amber ales\n\n# Ideal for People who Like\n\nEuropean cafes and checkered tablecloths, San Pellegrino\n\n# Drink While You Are\n\nEating moules frites or Belgian waffles, seeking a sophisticated beverage.\n\n# Pair With\n\nCheese, rich desserts, risotto, mustard greens, chili\n","crispRich":0.6,"createdAt":"2016-01-11T03:13:49.891Z","drySweet":0.6,"ibu":null,"label":"https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-2384_877ae_sm.jpeg","untappdID":"2384","brewer":"Brewery Ommegang","untappdString":"Rare Vos (Brewery Ommegang)","pdfURL":"https://res.cloudinary.com/brewpublik/image/upload/v1496325695/c5b6cxqb9ltfdvjrxc7l.pdf","style":"Red Ale - American Amber / Red","name":"Rare Vos","tags":[{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tag","objectId":"117"},{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tag","objectId":"5"},{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tag","objectId":"12"},{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tag","objectId":"13"},{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tag","objectId":"19"}],"searchedForUntappdID":true,"updatedAt":"2018-01-24T21:32:06.013Z","body":0.5,"abv":0.065,"collectionAssignments":[{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Collections","objectId":"HEansk5RZl"}],"maltHop":0.3,"tier":{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tier","objectId":"1"},"objectId":"524","__type":"Object","className":"Beer"},{"abv":0.055,"untappdID":"384799","brewer":"Modern Times Beer","name":"Lomaland","createdAt":"2016-06-06T17:30:14.643Z","updatedAt":"2018-01-24T21:32:07.300Z","label":"https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-384799_27d4c_sm.jpeg","ibu":30,"searchedForUntappdID":true,"style":"Saison / Farmhouse Ale","body":0.63,"drySweet":0.69,"maltHop":0.33,"crispRich":0.57,"description":"Malt: Pilsner, Wheat, Corn, 2-Row.

The original brown ales struggled against pale malts, which were more efficient in brewing. However, the style came back in the end of the 19th century and then became a mainstay in the new American craft brewing.\n\n# The Boys' Take\n\nMan, this is good! Chocolate, vanilla, and a hint of nuttiness all combine and for a smooth, easy-drinking and flat-out delicious beer.\n\n# About the Brewer\n\nAdam Avery started Avery Brewery in 1993 in Boulder, CO. It was bold at the time to open a brewery, and Avery started small. However, now today is established solidly as a quality brewer out of the brewery mecca of Denver/Boulder. Avery is committed to making original beer‚Ä¶ and not just what everybody wants. This means that it hasn't had the same commercial success, but also means it gets to keep a solid reputation with the experts. Some of the best aggressive beers come from here- especially the seasonal Dictator series- which contains traditional classic styles on steroids.

To celebrate. Sierra Nevada brews an aggressive, hop-forward ale using a lot of those hops fresh from the harvest. The Cascade and Centennial hops bring the citrus flavor and then finally Chinook comes in with the piney taste and aroma.\n\n# The Boy's Take\n\nYou'll smell all those fresh hops right away with the grapefruit aroma and taste them right away too. This is rare in a Christmas beer to have such strong, sharp flavor, but it feels like a perfect celebration of the new hops that just came in. Merry Christmas.\n\n# About the Brewer\n\nThe third-largest craft brewer in the US, Sierra Nevada has proven that it belongs at the very top of the rankings since 1980. From the beginning, Sierra Nevada beer has been a celebration of spicy American hops, and they've never backed down from that. And they've earned their upper-tier position by forging a path that in 1980 barely existed. Hops were hard to find. Brewery equipment didn't come on a micro scale. Then they came up with the Pale Ale, which was instrumental in bringing the West Coast style to the mainstream. Finally in 1987, Sierra Nevada moved into downtown Chico and setup shop. Now they are a N. California fixture and also have a brewery in the works in Asheville, NC. To this day, Sierra Nevada is still synonymous with hoppy, fresh beer, and we hope that never changes.\n\n# Drink this if You Like\n\nThe smell and taste of hops, bitter pales, IPAs\n\n# Ideal for People who Like\n\nFarm-to-bottle, things being as fresh as possible, hops\n\n# Drink While You Are\n\nStanding under the mistletoe, taking a break from the Christmas punch\n\n# Pair With\n\nFish and chips, Turkey, Polenta, Grilled Veggies, Dry/Sharp cheese\n","createdAt":"2016-01-11T03:13:48.838Z","crispRich":0.6,"drySweet":0.6,"ibu":null,"label":"https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-16630_3170b_sm.jpeg","untappdID":"16630","brewer":"Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.","untappdString":"Celebration Ale (Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.)","style":"IPA -

It's balanced, strong malt backbone, citrusy nose, with hints of pine and grass.\n\n# What you should know\n\nUinta originally named this beer \"Hop Notch\"- meaning still unknown to us- but quickly ran into trademark trouble and had to change the name to Hop Nosh (which actually makes more sense to us, as you are \"noshing\" on some hops with this drink).\n\n# The Boy's Take\n\nWhere the guys at Uinta get this is right is by provide a solid backbone of malt to hold up the mostly citrusy hops. You'll taste bitterness midway through this drink, and then at the end, it'll be a bit of earthy, roasty taste (just a bit). And you'll want another.\n\n# About the Brewer\n\nUinta is in a bit of a strange situation. A successful craft brewer since 1993, Uinta brews a variety of amazing beers, but is based in Salt Lake City, Utah- a state where only beers under 4% ABV are allowed in grocery stores (anything else is treated like liquor). This means that the biggest brewery in the state doesn't even sell a single can in grocery stores in the state!

These factors make 21st Amendment one of the coolest. For some reason, there's just nothing like beer in a can.

We thank our hops every day that the English loved their bitters‚Äîor else the IPA style may not have been born to help the beer survive the journey from Cape Hope to India back in the 18th century\n\n# What you should know\n\nThis is your traditional American West Coast IPA- lots of Columbus hops flavor and then dry-hopping with Centennial. Centennial hops are one of our favorites- a nice piney smell and citrusy taste.\n\n# The Boys' Take\n\nNot flashy, so solid. A really nice body of malts holds up the floral tastes that we are desperately seeking. Due to the Centennial dry-hopping, we get a lot of grassy and flowery flavor here.\n\n# About the Brewer\n\nBallast Point, out of San Diego, started as a small group of home brewers who just wanted to try some new beers. Their constant thirst for experimentation and exploration has now grown to one of the giants of the massive San Diego brewing scene. Their M-O is to constantly tinker, try to release new options, look at things from new angles and make room for themselves in what can be a crowded craft beer world. As a side note, they also distill liquor- so check that out. Founder Jack White started with just a homebrew kit at his house in 1992, and by 1996, the brewery had been born. Today, they make just about every style, with favorites being the IPAs Sculpin, Big Eye, Dorado Double and the porter, Victory at Sea\n\n# Drink this if You Like\n\nIPAs, Double IPAs\n\n# Ideal for People who Like\n\nSan Diego, Coronado, Grapefruit, the smell of freshly-cut grass\n\n# Drink While You Are\n\nEating sushi, resting after kiteboarding\n\n# Food Pairings\n\nSweet Hawaiian fish, Curry, Cured meat\n","createdAt":"2016-01-11T03:13:48.557Z","crispRich":0.6,"drySweet":0.6,"ibu":71,"label":"https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-_2447_sm_3f30697720fe62f2769e568febad87.jpeg","untappdID":"2447","brewer":"Ballast Point Brewing Company","untappdString":"Big Eye IPA (Ballast Point Brewing & Spirits)","pdfURL":"https://res.cloudinary.com/brewpublik/image/upload/v1496244003/wwx5iylqegjix8k0knki.pdf","style":"IPA -

Cascade, Chinook, and Columbus hops combine to provide an explosive burst of piney bitterness and lucioius notes of apricot, grapefruit, and mango that are sure to envoke imagery of swinging palms and sun-kissed shores.\n\n# What You Should Know\n\nThe Islander IPA swings for a tropical home run. All three of the C's (the hop varieties used here) come with a fruity, juicy taste.\n\n# The Boy's Take\n\nThis one is sweeter than most IPAs, with a light body that does surprisingly well to not taste like alcohol at 7%. A the finish, it really does carry a little bit like a nice Tequila Sunrise, with some citrusy sweetness.\n\n# About the Brewer\n\nCoronado Brewery is proud of its San Diego island roots. The brewhouse itself was right there on what maybe America's greatest beach (Coronado) and their first keg delivery was straight to the Hotel Del Coronado. From the beginning, brothers Ron and Rick Chapman have been focused on brewing truly west-coast style ales- look for bold, fresh taste. Their brewing capacity is now close to 60,000 barrels a year, and we can't wait for an ever-greater selection to be available here on the Right Coast. For now, look for the Orange Ave Wit, the Islander IPA and Idiot IPA (lots of hops)\n\n# Drink this if You Like\n\nWest Coast IPAs, Tropical Drinks\n\n# Ideal for People who Like\n\nMojitos, Pina Coladas, Sunbathing\n\n# Drink While You Are\n\nFinding your beach, doing some California Dreaming\n\n# Food Pairings\n\nCurried food, Thai food, peppery cheese, sharp cheddar\n","createdAt":"2016-01-11T03:13:51.426Z","crispRich":0.7,"drySweet":0.6,"ibu":null,"label":"https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-13018_e45b3_sm.jpeg","untappdID":"13018","brewer":"Coronado Brewing Company","untappdString":"Islander IPA (Coronado Brewing Company)","pdfURL":"https://res.cloudinary.com/brewpublik/image/upload/v1496326181/bzjija7x8x6zkpogfij3.pdf","style":"IPA - American","name":"Islander IPA","tags":[{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tag","objectId":"5"},{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tag","objectId":"19"},{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tag","objectId":"49"},{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tag","objectId":"53"}],"searchedForUntappdID":true,"updatedAt":"2018-01-24T21:32:13.493Z","body":0.7,"abv":0.07,"collectionAssignments":[{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Collections","objectId":"iWwvRdKKEf"}],"tier":{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tier","objectId":"1"},"maltHop":0.7,"objectId":"309","__type":"Object","className":"Beer"},{"untappdID":"2312422","name":"Nelson the Greeter","brewer":"Port Brewing Company","abv":0.001,"ibu":0,"label":"https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-2312422_c3f9f_sm.jpeg","style":"IPA - American","createdAt":"2017-12-22T20:23:25.335Z","updatedAt":"2018-01-24T21:32:26.699Z","collectionAssignments":[{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Collections","objectId":"iWwvRdKKEf"}],"objectId":"gESgBvakuo","__type":"Object","className":"Beer"},{"name":"Atticus IPA","brewer":"Strand Brewing Co.","abv":0.07200000000000001,"ibu":0,"label":"https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/assets/images/temp/badge-beer-default.png","style":"IPA","untappdID":"18863","createdAt":"2017-05-15T00:22:30.085Z","updatedAt":"2018-01-24T21:32:31.711Z","collectionAssignments":[{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Collections","objectId":"iWwvRdKKEf"}],"objectId":"JyEf4VTUFX","__type":"Object","className":"Beer"},{"untappdID":"1741133","name":"Tropical Torpedo","brewer":"Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.","label":"https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-1741133_c3c87_sm.jpeg","abv":0.067,"ibu":null,"createdAt":"2016-12-30T12:42:35.900Z","updatedAt":"2018-01-24T21:32:24.717Z","searchedForUntappdID":true,"style":"IPA - American","collectionAssignments":[{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Collections","objectId":"iWwvRdKKEf"}],"objectId":"ZjALWoBjoB","__type":"Object","className":"Beer"},{"name":"Doin' Crime Wheat IPA","brewer":"Federation Brewing","abv":0.064,"ibu":0,"label":"https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/assets/images/temp/badge-beer-default.png","untappdID":"2032890","createdAt":"2017-10-10T13:39:20.536Z","updatedAt":"2018-01-24T21:32:14.346Z","collectionAssignments":[{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Collections","objectId":"iWwvRdKKEf"}],"objectId":"9RKLjkrS4Q","__type":"Object","className":"Beer"},{"breweryDBID":"jhjlYL","updatedAt":"2018-01-24T21:32:29.590Z","abv":0.065,"brewer":"Speakeasy Ales & Lagers","breweryDBString":"Big Daddy IPA (Speakeasy Ales and Lagers)","untappdID":"917","name":"Big Daddy IPA","untappdString":"Big Daddy IPA (Speakeasy Ales & Lagers)","createdAt":"2016-01-25T05:06:40.066Z","ibu":null,"label":"https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-BigDaddyIPA_917.jpeg","searchedForUntappdID":true,"style":"IPA - American","collectionAssignments":[{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Collections","objectId":"iWwvRdKKEf"}],"objectId":"ubxtMq4txC","__type":"Object","className":"Beer"},{"untappdID":"3587","createdAt":"2016-02-24T23:13:30.746Z","updatedAt":"2018-01-24T21:34:59.340Z","name":"Mirror Pond Pale Ale","brewer":"Deschutes Brewery","abv":0.05,"label":"https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-3587_042e9_sm.jpeg","ibu":null,"searchedForUntappdID":true,"style":"Pale Ale - American","body":null,"drySweet":null,"maltHop":null,"crispRich":null,"pdfURL":"https://res.cloudinary.com/brewpublik/image/upload/v1495809540/sxxrl0ckmvrjbqz2088z.pdf","collectionAssignments":[{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Collections","objectId":"iWwvRdKKEf"}],"objectId":"Pgj3RT0kc8","__type":"Object","className":"Beer"},{"brewer":"Lost Coast","createdAt":"2016-01-11T03:13:48.456Z","updatedAt":"2018-01-24T21:34:59.748Z","ibu":null,"drySweet":0.6,"abv":0.07400000000000001,"crispRich":0.6,"body":0.5,"tier":{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tier","objectId":"1"},"maltHop":0.7,"tags":[],"name":"Red IPA","untappdID":"761381","untappdString":"Red IPA (Lost Coast Brewery)","description":"\n# Beer Description\n\nOur Red IPA has full-bodied flavor from ample Pale\nmalts while specialty malts provide a deep ruby hue.

The hot wort is only cooled by steam from San Francisco air. To be honest, we're not sure what effect that has. But it most do something. Anyway, a trip to Anchor is a real treat.

And we think that a better view can actually make a better beer. Hoppy, but not overwhelming, Villager is a really refreshing, fresh-tasting IPA that will scratch that hop-head itch you know you have.\n\n# About the Brewer:  \n\nFort Point Beer Company was founded in 2014 by Tyler and Justin Catalana. Fort Point is really proud to be a San Francisco brewery and that pride is reflected in their beer. The brewery is located in the Presidio in a historic building that once housed an Army motor pool.

The hot wort is only cooled by steam from San Francisco air.  To be honest, we‚Äôre not sure what effect that has.  But it most do something.  Anyway, a trip to Anchor is a real treat.

It is brewed using a decoction mash, a time consuming, traditional four vessel brewing process discarded by many contemporary brewers. This process brings forth a rich sweetness from the malt that makes it well worth the effort. Samuel Adams Boston Lager¬Æ also uses only the finest of ingredients including two row barley, as well as German Noble aroma hops. The exclusive use of two row barley not only imparts a full, smooth body but also gives the beer a wide spectrum of malt flavor ranging from slightly sweet to caramel to slightly roasted. The Noble hops varieties, Hallertau Mittelfruh and Tettnang Tettnanger, add a wide range of floral, piney and citrus notes, which are present from the aroma, through the flavor, to the lingering smooth finish. We take great pride in the Noble hops used in our beers. They are hand selected by Jim Koch and our other brewers from the world's oldest hops growing area. Among the world's most expensive, they cost twenty times as much as other hops.\n\n# What you should know\n\nThis was the beer that some say started it all. It was Boston Beer (Sam Adams) very first beer, and one of the first that lead the revolution of using the highest quality ingredients and brewed to a premium quality.\n\n# The Boys' Take\n\nIt's been such a long time, it's easy to overlook the old Boston Lager, but there's something to be said for the straight-forward, traditional taste of the beer that \"started it all\"\n\n# About the Brewer\n\nBoston Beer (aka Sam Adams) is the 300-pound gorilla in any craft beer conversation. In fact, the official definition of \"craft beer\" was changed in 2010 to make sure Sam Adams was considered craft beer, when they first brewed more than 2 million barrels. Their 2013 revenues were more than 3 times the second-biggest brewer. So yeah, we're talking a different ball game. This makes Sam Adams a divisive topic in the craft beer world. If you listen to Boston Beer, they are still a great innovator and help open a bigger market for craft beer with their big budget and TV ad campaigns.

A midday go-to, Nooner is our take on the classic German-style pilsner‚Äîone of the original session beers. Nooner is easy drinking yet packed with the big flavor of spicy and floral whole-cone hops. Its brilliant golden color begs you to take a sip and sink your taste buds into an extremely welcoming beer, full of flavor and balanced by a crisp, dry finish.\n\n# The Boy's Take\n\nThis here is a quality pilsener. Not spicy or bitey, it's quality-made, with just a little bit of malt to hold everything together. Generally, the taste is very dry\n\n# About the Brewer\n\nThe third-largest craft brewer in the US, Sierra Nevada has proven that it belongs at the very top of the rankings since 1980. From the beginning, Sierra Nevada beer has been a celebration of spicy American hops, and they've never backed down from that. And they've earned their upper-tier position by forging a path that in 1980 barely existed. Hops were hard to find. Brewery equipment didn't come on a micro scale. Then they came up with the Pale Ale, which was instrumental in bringing the West Coast style to the mainstream. Finally in 1987, Sierra Nevada moved into downtown Chico and setup shop. Now they are a N. California fixture and also have a brewery in the works in Asheville, NC. To this day, Sierra Nevada is still synonymous with hoppy, fresh beer, and we hope that never changes.\n\n# Drink this if You Like\n\nPilseners, golden ales\n\n# Ideal for People who Like\n\nA mid-day break, lazy Sundays, deck chairs\n\n# Drink While You Are\n\nGearing up for an adventure\n\n# Pair With\n\nCured ham, Mahi fish, Pasta, Gruyere\n","crispRich":0.4,"createdAt":"2016-01-11T03:13:49.899Z","drySweet":0.4,"ibu":38,"label":"https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-913150_b0c1c_sm.jpeg","untappdID":"913150","brewer":"Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.","untappdString":"Nooner Pilsner (Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.)","pdfURL":"https://res.cloudinary.com/brewpublik/image/upload/v1504118299/mp3mjaxfqv4fsoqguogj.pdf","style":"Pilsner - German","name":"Nooner Pilsner","tags":[{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tag","objectId":"117"},{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tag","objectId":"5"},{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tag","objectId":"19"},{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tag","objectId":"107"},{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tag","objectId":"134"}],"searchedForUntappdID":true,"updatedAt":"2018-01-24T21:32:57.121Z","body":0.3,"abv":0.052,"collectionAssignments":[{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Collections","objectId":"4tNJgdXDwd"}],"tier":{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tier","objectId":"2"},"maltHop":0.5,"objectId":"588","__type":"Object","className":"Beer"},{"label":"https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-_524080_sm_dc70c81cdf8a89f421357dc844acde.jpeg","updatedAt":"2018-01-24T21:35:24.434Z","untappdID":"524080","abv":0.053,"brewer":"Speakeasy Ales & Lagers","ibu":null,"createdAt":"2016-05-19T22:19:34.461Z","name":"Metropolis Lager","searchedForUntappdID":true,"style":"Lager - Pale","body":null,"drySweet":null,"maltHop":null,"crispRich":null,"pdfURL":"https://res.cloudinary.com/brewpublik/image/upload/v1496240813/q4erzsf8ohm0hanx549x.pdf","collectionAssignments":[{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Collections","objectId":"4tNJgdXDwd"}],"objectId":"dNBBhx6Htk","__type":"Object","className":"Beer"},{"name":"Hefeweizen","untappdID":"630817","abv":0.053,"updatedAt":"2018-01-24T21:32:40.844Z","brewer":"Brauerei Schneider Essing","ibu":0,"createdAt":"2016-07-07T00:29:27.669Z","label":"https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-630817_924ba_sm.jpeg","searchedForUntappdID":true,"style":"Hefeweizen","collectionAssignments":[{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Collections","objectId":"4tNJgdXDwd"}],"objectId":"0fVqqfB7l1","__type":"Object","className":"Beer"},{"createdAt":"2016-05-13T06:25:10.081Z","updatedAt":"2018-01-24T21:32:57.955Z","name":"329 Lager","untappdID":"593409","brewer":"Golden Road Brewing","abv":0.048,"ibu":25,"body":0.2,"drySweet":0.5,"maltHop":0.3,"crispRich":0.2,"label":"https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-593409_9b7dd_sm.jpeg","description":"# Beer Description: \n\nCrafted in the city that gives us 329 days of sun, 329 Lager is the perfect companion for making the most of sunny California days.

It is a process that combines deep respect for craft brewing tradition with many decades of evolution to arrive at a unique approach: a blend of pale and caramel malts, fermentation with lager yeast at warmer ale temperatures in shallow open-air fermenters, and gentle carbonation in our cellars through an all-natural process called kr√§usening.\n\n# What You Should Know\n\nThe open-air fermentation process leads to a flavor complexity and a taste different really from any other beer.\n\n# The Boys' Take\n\nMuch like steam, this one is thin and light- but it has a stiff bite. You'll definitely taste both barley and hops here.\n\n# About the Brewer\n\nAnchor Steam beer is puritanical in their pursuit in time-honored methods of brewing. Established in the 19th century, Anchor somehow managed to survive the Prohibition and kept on brewing in San Francisco until today. Their most famous beer is the Steam Beer, which is distinguished by being brewed in open air tanks (rather than tall vertical tanks used by other breweries). The hot wort is only cooled by steam from San Francisco air. To be honest, we're not sure what effect that has. But it most do something. Anyway, a trip to Anchor is a real treat.

The brewery is actually situated in the middle of an old hops farm in Cooperstown, NY.  Cooperstown, the home of the Baseball Hall of Fame now, used to also be home to the largest hop-growing area in the US (pre-prohibition).  Anyway, with the help of Duvel (a Belgian brewing conglomerate), the farmhouse was built in 1997, In 2003, Duvel went ahead and purchased the brewery.   In brewing premium Belgian ales, Ommegang draws on the special water available in the area, imported Bavarian hops and their own house yeast.  Together, all these ingredients lead to a very impressive combination of Belgians brewed in the US.

This easy drinking beer has fruity and floral notes with a clean finish. A healthy dose of wheat malt adds to the complexity you would expect from a blonde.\n\n# What You Need to Know\n\nThe Blonde ale is actually a creation of American craft brewers to explain a less-extensively hopped, but still pale, ale made traditionally in England. Used to light lagers, American drinkers quickly took to this maltier style- and then Blonde Ales found their way back to England as a style all their own!\n\n# The Boys' Take\n\nTip a few of these back- they're easy to drink! The taste is mostly malt, with some floral hop flavor, but nothing too crazy\n\n# About the Brewer\n\nFortnight is definitely the total hybrid of English sensibilities and, well, America. The brewery is drab and unassuming, but walk in, and there is tons of room- high ceilings and space to breathe (something you don't see in many pubs). But the magnificent wooden bar is there, with a couple of casks perched for on-the-spot infusions and aging. Yes, Fortnight is very much a representation of, well, England, and all its beers fill that mold. Now, English beers are not like American ones- they are typically lower in both alcohol and complexity, but no less care is used in making them. The good thing is that you can have five while watching soccer and get away with it.

The Curacao orange hails from the island of the same name (actually a part of the Dutch kingdom) and its peel has been used in the last century to spice up Belgian whites. This variety of orange is actually way too bitter to eat, but the pungency of its peel makes for a great counter-balance to the soft, wheat-y malt of the beer.\n\n# The Boys' Take\n\nThis is soft and citrusy and a little heavier than some other white beers. This is what we would say is just pleasant to drink- almost velvet in the mouth and sweet to the tongue.\n\n# About the Brewer\n\nAdam Avery started Avery Brewery in 1993 in Boulder, CO. It was bold at the time to open a brewery, and Avery started small. However, now today is established solidly as a quality brewer out of the brewery mecca of Denver/Boulder. Avery is committed to making original beer‚Ä¶ and not just what everybody wants. This means that it hasn't had the same commercial success, but also means it gets to keep a solid reputation with the experts. Some of the best aggressive beers come from here- especially the seasonal Dictator series- which contains traditional classic styles on steroids. If like a drop-kick to the face of fresh hops in the springtime, check out The Maharaja- an Imperial IPA.\n\n# Drink this if You Like\n\nUnfiltered beer, Belgians, wheat beer\n\n# Ideal for People who Like\n\nCitrusy drinks, comfort-down mattresses, playful devils\n\n# Drink While You Are\n\nKicking back with an orange slice, up to some minor mischief\n\n# Pair With\n\nSpicy food such as thai or Mexican, blackened fish, ceviche\n","createdAt":"2016-01-11T03:13:47.589Z","crispRich":0.3,"drySweet":0.6,"ibu":null,"label":"https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-WhiteRascal_6109.jpeg","untappdID":"6109","brewer":"Avery Brewing Co.","untappdString":"White Rascal (Avery Brewing Company)","pdfURL":"https://res.cloudinary.com/brewpublik/image/upload/v1496243597/xzvdgd4qwtjbzgepgspv.pdf","style":"Witbier","name":"White Rascal","tags":[{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tag","objectId":"117"},{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tag","objectId":"5"},{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tag","objectId":"19"},{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tag","objectId":"91"}],"searchedForUntappdID":true,"updatedAt":"2018-01-24T21:35:30.613Z","body":0.3,"abv":0.056,"collectionAssignments":[{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Collections","objectId":"4tNJgdXDwd"}],"tier":{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Tier","objectId":"2"},"maltHop":0.3,"objectId":"224","__type":"Object","className":"Beer"},{"untappdID":"1130373","abv":0.055,"brewer":"Green Flash Brewing Company","createdAt":"2016-03-05T21:20:26.823Z","updatedAt":"2018-01-24T21:35:31.107Z","ibu":null,"name":"Passion Fruit Kicker","maltHop":0.4,"drySweet":0.5,"crispRich":0.5,"body":0.4,"label":"https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-1130373_1cb25_sm.jpeg","description":"# Beer Description\n\nWe‚Äôve kicked it up a notch by adding a tropical twist to this refreshing ale.

From the beginning, Sierra Nevada beer has been a celebration of spicy American hops, and they‚Äôve never backed down from that.  And they‚Äôve earned their upper-tier position by forging a path that in 1980 barely existed.  Hops were hard to find.  Brewery equipment didn‚Äôt come on a micro scale.  Then they came up with the Pale Ale, which was instrumental in bringing the West Coast style to the mainstream.  Finally in 1987, Sierra Nevada moved into downtown Chico and setup shop.  Now they are a N. California fixture and also have a brewery in the works in Asheville, NC.  To this day, Sierra Nevada is still synonymous with hoppy, fresh beer, and we hope that never changes.\n\n# Drink this if You Like\n\nGoses, Lactobacillus-based beers, Wheat beer\n\n# Ideal for People who Like\n\nPrickly Pear, San Pelegrino, friendly bacteria\n\n# Drink While You Are\n\nLooking for crisp, cool refreshment, enjoying a late Spring brunch\n\n# Pair With\n\nSmoked Salmon, Oysters, Pad Thai, Bitter Greens\n","searchedForUntappdID":true,"style":"Sour - Gose","pdfURL":"https://res.cloudinary.com/brewpublik/image/upload/v1509716215/sfsqhn8xudnnvruzkpcd.pdf","collectionAssignments":[{"__type":"Pointer","className":"Collections","objectId":"ldmgERlxU0"}],"objectId":"H92ClpbHSC","__type":"Object","className":"Beer"},{"description":"\n# Beer Description\n\nOur Blood Orange Gose is a tart, refreshing wheat ale that is kettle-soured with lactobacillus and brewed with sea salt and coriander.

The original brewery was in the basement of a brewpub run by Ken Allen, and beer operations started in earnest way back in 1987.  After really killing it for a few years, Ken moved to a huge, gleaming brewhouse in the middle of nowhere in Northern Cali.  Well, in 2010 Ken did retire, leaving the company to Trey White, who partnered with brewmaster Fal Allen (no relation to Ken).  Since then Trey and Fal have taken Anderson Valley national and jumped whole-heartedly into seasonal and barrel-aging scene.

The subtle sweetness imparted by the lactose balances the sharpness of the highly roasted grains which give this delicious beer its black color.\n\n# What you should know\n\nMilk stouts are made using lactose, which is a sugar undigestable by beer yeast. This leaves a lot more sugar than usual in the beer, giving it a richer taste and feel than some other beers. Milk stouts are typically lighter on the malts than others to compensate for this.\n\n# The Boys' Take\n\nA beer milkshake? Yes, please! Although it is sweet, the Duck Rabbit Milk Stout is well balanced, and carries along some rich coffee and chocolate taste along its smooth, smooth ride. Have it on nitro for true mouth-jazz.\n\n# About the Brewer\n\nPaul Philippon was teaching Philosophy in North Carolina when he began thinking about the meaning of life. After pondering that for a long time, he realized that this was a very complex subject- so he decided to drink beer instead. And thus his love of beer grew, until, suddenly, Paul was ready to brew beer. And thus became The Duck-Rabbit Brewery in Farmville, NC. What is a Duck-Rabbit, you might ask? Well, take a look at the distinctive logo for this brewery. Do you see a Duck or a Rabbit? A rabbit or a duck? Think about it. And then think about what your answer says about you. Honestly, we have no idea, but D-R makes some great, award-winning beer. They are mostly traditional styles, but we say go for the Milk Stout, the Rabid Duck Russian Imperial or the Baltic Porter for the most bang for your buck.\n\n# Drink this if You Like\n\nSweet porters and browns, milk stouts\n\n# Ideal for People who Like\n\nCream in the their coffee, Chocolate milk\n\n# Drink While You Are\n\nReady for a nap, satisfying your sweet tooth\n\n# Pair With\n\nBread pudding, chocolate, cheesecake, pork tenderloin, glazed veggies, roasted veggies\n\n","searchedForUntappdID":true,"style":"Stout -

The perfect reward for an honest day's work and the ultimate companion to celebrate life's simple pleasures.\n\n# What you should know\n\nSession IPAs are some of the most difficult beers to create, because lower ABV means lower malt, which means that the flavor of hops can become hard to mask. As much as the hopheads might say it, nobody munches on hop buds, and there's a reason for that. But Founder's Brewmaster Jeremy Kosmicki wanted a beer he could drink a decent amount of but still have flavor. So he created All-Day IPA, a beer with all the IPA flavor, but still plenty of pound-ability. That's All-Day IPA\n\n# The Boys' Take\n\nRefreshing as all get out and great for a summer day, the focus that we tasted here is a bit of hops, with light body and taste.

This keeps the flavors crisp and clear (instead of influences by other flavors in the air). The raspberries are added after the beer is bottled.\n\n# About the Brewer\n\nAbita was founded in 1986, and is in many ways the quintessential Southern beer.
